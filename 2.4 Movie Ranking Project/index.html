<h1>Best Movie Ranking According to AARUSHI</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Sanam teri kasam</h3>
<p>It's a slow burn kind of movie, at the start it feels like just another ordinary movie, however slowly you feel so drawn towards it that you are in awe and tears by the end.
    
    It's one of those kinds of movies which will just make you deeply sad but also will give a lesson about the meaning of true love and how gaining and losing it feels like.
    
    Definitely one of the all time greats according to me. I am so glad people are recognizing it's worth now.</p>
<h3>jab we met</h3>
<p>SUCH a good movie! I was really blown away with how tight and clean the narrative was, but it was still a complex story.
         The jokes were really funny and hit really well,
         the dialogues also worked WITH the cinematography to come together and tell a story.</p>
<h3>hasee toh phasee</h3>
<p>Hasee Toh Phasee is a quirky, feel-good rom-com that stands out with its fresh storytelling and charming performances.
     Parineeti Chopra is brilliant as the unconventional Meeta, and her chemistry with Sidharth Malhotra feels real and heartwarming. 
     The film is a perfect mix of humor, emotion, and soulful music. A delightful watch</p>
